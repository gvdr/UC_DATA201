## Overview

Transforming one or many datasets from a source format into a target format by cleaning, selecting, filtering, mapping, aggregating, joining, binding, ..., different data types. This course offers an introduction to R programming for data manipulation.

## Assessment

|Assessment       |    Due Date |    Percentage|
|-----------------:|-----------|:--------:|
|participation    | end of course  |  10%|
|weekly labs      | Fridays at 18  |     20%|
|lab peer-reviews | Mondays at 18  |    20%|
|group project    | end of course  |    40%|
|project presentation| end of course  |  10%|

Weekly labs and constructive peer-reviews are handled via [github](github.com). No work done after the due dates is going to be evaluated (the `git commit` time will be used to assess this); you have 24 hours to hand in (`git push`) your work. Therefore, commit often during the week: the course is fastpaced, and it is better (for me and for you) to hand in a partial lab rather one week rather than accumulating delay in following weeks.

## Description

Data wrangling is the iterative process of transforming data from a source format into a format suitable for storage, analysis, visualization, communication. The process is constrained by the requirement of preserving as much of the relevant information contained in the dataset, as well as ensuring an ethical treatment of the data subject, e.g., protecting their security and privacy. The course aims to provide the students tools to handle different source formats (csvs, spreadsheets, web pages, apis, ...), some target formats (long / wide data frames, packages, ...) and a variety of data kinds (dates, numeric, strings, text, ...). Wherever possible, the students will work on real world datasets and ethical facets of data wrangling will be explicitly discussed in class. During the course, R will be the default programming language, and the use of JupyterLab and Rstudio strongly encouraged. Reference to other programming languages (Python, Julia) will be provided. Peer, group, and class interaction will be explicitly required during the course.

## Learning Outcomes

Having engaged in learning during the course, students will be able to:

1. Access (read in) different data formats;
2. Interact (manipulate) relational dataset (e.g., data frames) and hierarchical dataset (e.g., JSON);
3. Output (write to) different data formats;
4. Analyse a dataset in order to identify its format and possible errors;
5. Analyse a data wrangling problem:
  1. identify the available source format(s)
  2. define the suitable target format(s) and the relevant ethical / technical constraints
  3. develop a flow to transform data from source to target formats.
6. Develop (code and document) an R package.
