## Overview

This course strive to be a little bit different than normal. Long story short: **your active engagement is vital** to the course outcome, both as individuals and as a community. Data Science is, largely, an interdisciplinary team effort. And that is true also in this class. **Constructive collaboration is a hard requirement.** We value the clarity, the accessibility, the reproducibility, the ethicity of good data science: this course is not only about complicated coding.

The [Course Syllabus](/syllabus) will be updated with assignments, lecture material and readings during the course. The lecture plan is subject to change.

### Flipped classroom

We adopt a [flipped classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) model. Hands on activities, labs, readings, come before the lectures. You, the learner, face the unknown. This is what happens routinely in the work place. In this learning setting I, the instructor, am there to help you out if you get stuck. **Labs** start with a short tutorial by me (or a guest), then you work in [pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) on some data and exercises. **Lectures** start with a Q&A session, followed by a more classic frontal lecture time where I try and present a theoretical framework for the concept you are working on.
